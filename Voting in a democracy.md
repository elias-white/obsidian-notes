Over the course of history, those who can and cannot vote have changed dramatically.

In Ancient Greek democracy, only a small proportion of the population could vote. Women, slaves and foreigners could not vote.

In Australian democracy, women were granted the right to vote in 1902 and indigenous inidviduals in 1962.

For [[ Rousseau on Democracy | Rousseau's democracy ]], only propertied males ought to be granted voting rights as those without a greater stake are more likely to throw away their vote.

For [[ Mill on Democracy | Mill's democracy]], illiterate people should not be able to vote. 

Some key questions on voting rights:
	- Who can vote _responsibly_?
	- Are limitations of non-dominant classes _natural_ or _conditioned_?
