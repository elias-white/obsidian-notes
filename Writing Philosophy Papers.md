Writing a philosophy paper
- Writing a philosophy paper involves putting forward an argument for something.
- You are trying to persuade your (imaginary) audience of your view through the force of rational argumentation, not passionate rhetoric 
- Writing a philosophy paper is not about summarizing what other theorists have argued in relation to your chosen topic. It is about contributing to existing conversations with your own thoughts, arguments, ideas, examples etc.... (difficult, we know!) 
- In a first year philosophy paper, your word count is limited. Only include in your exegesis (i.e. summary of existing material) that content which is relevant to, and which helps to set up, your main argument/s.
- What is too little? What is too much? Well, practice makes perfect......
