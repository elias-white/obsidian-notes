An appeal in the [[ Rhetoric | rhetorical ]] sense is a strategy used in an attempt to persuade an audience. In order to appeal to the audience, we can do three things:[^1]

1. A rhetorician employs [[Logos]], appealing to their sense of logic.
2. [[ Appeal to Ethos ]], by providing credibility to himself and the arguments he/she presents
3. Appeal to [[Pathos]], drawing on the emotions and feelings of the audience so they will be sympathetic to the arguments or ideas being spoken or written

Appeals can be either [[ Situated Appeal | situated ]] or [[ Invented Appeal | invented ]].
