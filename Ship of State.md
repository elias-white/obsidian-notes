Ship of State refers to an [[Allegory]] inside of Plato's Republic.

> There is the ship-owner, larger and stronger than everyone on the ship, but somewhat deaf and rather short-sighted, with a knowledge of sailing to match his eyesight. The sailors are quarreling among themselves over captaincy of the ship, each one thinking that he ought to be captain, though he has never learn that skill… On top of which they say it can’t be taught. In fact, they’re prepared to cut to pieces anyone who says it can…. They beg him and do everything they can to make him hand over the tiller to them. Sometimes, if other people can persuade him and they can’t, they kill those others or throw them overboard. Then they immobilize their worthy ship-owner with drugs or drinks or by some other means, and take control of the ship, helping themselves  to what  it is carrying. Drinking and feasting they sail in the way you expect people like that to sail... If someone is good at finding them ways of persuading or compelling the ship-owner to let them take control, they call him a real seaman, a real captain, and say he really knows about ships.
