[[Iris Marion Young]] states that a social group is a collective of persons differentiated from at least one other group by cultural forms, practices, or way of life. These social groups are not primarily delineated by a set of shared attributes (skin colour, eye colour et), but by a sense of identity. Members  of these social groups have a kind of social bond with each other because of their similiar experiences or way of life.
