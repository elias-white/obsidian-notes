#### Rhetoric

Rhetoric refers to the art of utilitising all available language choices in order to convey an idea or intent effectively. It is not concerned about correctness, or [[Grammar]] and [[Logic]], is primarily concerned with effectiveness. An example of where the abandonment of the above is valid, would be in order to convey the idea of a 'stupid' character.

Rhetoric has garnered a bad reputation with phrases like "full of rhetoric" and "his speech was mere rhetoric", however, rhetoric is more than just the skillful use of language in order to manipulate an audience to achieve unjust ends. 

The purpose of a [[ Rhetorical Analysis ]] is not to agree or disagree, it is to understand the debate or discussion taking place.
