[[ Jean Jacques Rousseau ]] believed that democracy was both instrumentally valuable (democracies make better decisions and have better outcomes) and intrinsically valuable (valuable in and of itself because it holds key values of liberty and equality).

Rousseau constructed a model that he believed was superior to [[Plato on Democracy]] and the use of [[Plato's Guardians]].

To Rousseau, a state is only legitimate if it is guided by the [[ Rousseau's Conception of the General Will | general will ]]. 

The role of Rousseau's democratic government is not to make laws, rather, just to apply them. 

### Education
When it came to education, Rousseau agreed with [[ Plato ]] that training is necessary to create skilled rulers, however, he believed that this training should be available to all through civic training.

### Society
Rousseau advocated for a classless society as classes can create distinct opposing interests that can corrupt or cloud the [[Rousseau's Conception of the General Will | general will]], and to use education as a form of social bond.

In this democracy, the social unit is to be maintained through the use of censors, who discourage anti-social behaviour, and through the inculcation of [[ Civil Religion ]].

Only religions that promote tolerance are allowed, and athiesm is banned as Rousseau states any man that does fear the wrath of the divine is less inclined to do the right things. 

### Criticisms
- Potentially too repressive (see: [[Rousseau on Freedom]])
- Not sufficiently accommodating of diversity, pluralism, dissent
