[[ Martha Nussbaum]] asks the question as to what would happen if the parties involved in the [[Original Position]] were more diverse in their power and ability? In addition, these parties were also rich with feelings of benevolance and concern for others? 

#### A non-economic theory of value 
She notes that a [[Social Contract Theory | contract]] that places people as [[  Principle of Equal Basic Liberties | fully equal citizens]], with equal claims to healthcare, education and participation in the political sphere will not be to the mutual advantage of everyone where advantage is conceived purely in economic terms. 

Nussbaum drew inspiration from [[ Amartya Sen ]] when developing her non-economy theory of value. She infers that a single monetary metric is not a reliable indicator for an individuals well-being, as someone could be well-off economically but have poor well-being due to physical impairments or disabilities. 

#### Reclassification of Primary Goods
Nussbaum argues that Rawls needs to revisit the [[Liberalism# Liberalism on political persons | conception of the person ]] in order to reclassify [[ Rawls on Primary Goods | 'primary goods']] to include needs for care that citizens with severe impairments (lifelong or temporary) may need.

Therefore, she invites a moralised conception of the benefits of social cooperation that include compassion, love, justice and other benefits that may not have any obvious correlation with economic gain. 

Nussbaum proposes that we change the theory of [[ Rawls on Primary Goods |good]] to a list of human *capabilities* as opposed to a *list of things*. She states that any *just* society is one having a threshold of the very bare minimum of ten [[Nussbaum's List of Capabilities | central capabilities]]. If a state fails to meet this threshold, she states that that state fails to be *just* irrespective of their economic success or level of opulance.
