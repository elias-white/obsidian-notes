#### What is the Liberal Arts?
- The Liberal Arts denote the seven branches of knowledge or fields of study. The seven branches are divided into two categories:
	- [[The Trivium]]
	- [[The Quadrivium]]

- The Liberal Arts differ from the [[Utilitarian Arts]], as the [[Utilitarian Arts]] are transitive activities while the Liberal Arts are intransitive activities. 
	- A transitive activity is where the activity or action begins in the agent and ends in an object produced
	- An intransitive activity is where the activity or action begins in the agent and ends in the agent. (i.e. the rose bloomed)

- Each of the Liberal Arts are both a science and an art. as there exists in eac branch something to know (science) and something to do (art).
- Each of the Liberal Arts should not be understood in the narrowest sense of a single subject but rather a group of connected subjects
