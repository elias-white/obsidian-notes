- Social Groups can be distinguished from *associations* (church, sporting groups)
	- Associations are *constituted* by individuals
	- Social Groups *constitue* individuals 
- At first we are thrown into social groups, but then we choose to *take it up* in a certain way. Social groups are never 'founded'.
