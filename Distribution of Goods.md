The distribution of goods describes the distribution of material goods, rights and liberties within a society. 

Political scientists are interested in the descriptive question of *how are goods currently being distributed*?

[[John Rawls ]] proposed the [[Principles of Justice as Fairness]].

Some additional questions:
- On what basis should people possess property? 
- What rights and liberties should they enjoy?
- Is there a reason why one person should have more property than another?
- Are there any justified limits to my liberty?
