A successful rhetorician treats all subject matter fairly, extensively and effectively. There are some that argue the process of attaining information for the composition of rhetoric is seperate to the composition itself. However, a [[Being a Skilled Rhetorician | skilled rhetorician ]] understands that what we choose to say is closely tied to who we are it to and why we are saying it.[^1] 

It is generally advisable to always produce more material than he or she needs, so the rhetorician can *choose* what argument structure is most effective.

The subject matter chosen cannot be one which the audience already unanimously agrees on, as employing rhetoric here would be pointless since no persuasion takes place.
