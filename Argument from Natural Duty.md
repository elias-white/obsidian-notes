The Argument from Natural Duty refers to the argument that supports [[ Political Obligation ]]. The argument follows the following structure:

[[ Political Obligation ]] can be derived from the natural duties that human rights impose on us. We have a duty to do what we can within reason to ensure that our rights (right to life and bodily integrity) are not violated by others. This duty is naturally occurring and simply exists as a virtue of our status as moral agents. Obeying the state helps us fulfill this duty. 

There have been several challenges raised against this argument:
	1. This argument does not bind the agent to any particular political authority. It can be reasoned that in order to fulfull our natural duty to human rights, we ought to support a foreign state as opposed to our own. Another example could be the withholding of taxes in order to donate money to underdeveloped nations.
