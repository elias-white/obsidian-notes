In [[Political Philosophy]], an ideal theory is a theory that defines the optimum society using idealised assumptions as a foundation.

An ideal theory assumes that citizens enjoy positive social conditions and are fully compliant with the state. 

Ideal theories do not aim to offer solutions to real world, existing problems. Rather, they aim to guide society on how to improve by stating what society should normatively be.

A common criticism of ideal theory is that it is far too idealistic.
