Argument from Fairness refers to the argument in support of [[Political Obligation]], or our moral obligation to follow the law. This argument states that whether we [[ Argument for Consent | consent ]] to the law or not is irreleveant, as anyone who gains advantage from the existance of the state has a duty of fairness to obey its laws. Why should someone who reaps the benefits of the existance of a state not share the burden of participating in one? 

Philosophers have raised a few challenges to this argument, namely: 
	1. What about unsolicited benefits? These benefits create no obligation for reciprocation. 
	2. Can we even meaningfully refuse the benefits of a state?
	3. What about when individual disobedience does not cause any significant harm to the polity? Modern states are largely complex, highly impersonal and hierarchical and would not *feel* the disobedience.
