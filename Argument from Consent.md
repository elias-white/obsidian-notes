Argument from consent refers to the argument used to justify [[ Political Obligation ]]. [[ Thomas Hobbes | Hobbes ]] and [[ John Locke | Locke ]] claim that we [[ Social Contract Theory | contract out ]] of the [[ State of Nature ]] because of the difficulties we encounter therein, and submit ourselves to political authority. This consent to [[Political Power]] is a form of [[ Tacit Consent | tacit consent ]]. 

There have been a few challenges raised against this argument:
	- There has been no record of any explicit social contract event taking place in history and even if it did,
	- Why would this consent extend to future generations?
	- Even if we do not consent, can we truly ever opt out of the state?
