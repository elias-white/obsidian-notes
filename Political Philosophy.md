#### What is Political Philosophy?
Political Philosophy is primarily concerned with two questions:[^1]
1. How do we [[ Distribution of Goods | distribute goods]]? (material goods, rights and liberties)
2. How do we distribute [[political power]]?

Political philosopy is a normative discipline and therefore political philosophers conduct [[Normative Studies]]. However, it would be unwise to ignore the results of [[Descriptive Studies]]. An example where a Political Philosophy might be interested in a descriptive study would be in the study of human behaviour. 

#### Why do we study Political Philosophy?
Unlike other fields of Philosophy, you cannot hide from taking a position or stance on certain issues. By abstaining from a particular view, or electing to be [[agnosticism | agnostic ]], you are in fact taking a stance. By being agnostic you are simply placing your political will and power on status quo, however against you it may be.
