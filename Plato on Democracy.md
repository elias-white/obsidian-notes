[[ Plato ]] did not hold a positive view on [[ Democracy ]]. He explained that when we seek medical attention, we do not gather and vote on what treatment we should undertake, rather, we seek out individuals with  medical expertise. Plato saw that governing a state should be no different and that we should seek out individuals trained in managing the state, individuals he names [[ Plato's Guardians | Guardians ]]. 

As these Guardians serve the interests of the people of the people without being ruled *by the people*, it can also be referred to as a [[ Benevolent Dictatorship ]]. 

Further to this, Plato believed that managing a state is a skill that must be acquired to training and that not everyone is *naturally capable* of acquiring these skills. 

Plato shows the inadequecy of [[Democracy]] through the [[ Allegory ]] titled [[ Ship of State ]]. 

Some key criticisms for Plato's conception of the state:
- How can Guardians know what's best for the people? 
- How can we expect Guardian's to adjudicate between individuals preferences and interests?
