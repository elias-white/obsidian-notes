Persona in rhetoric is the character or personality of the speaker constructed for the benefit of the rhetoric being written or spoken. 

A rhetoritician who understands persona can do two things[^1] :
1. Manage how the audience perceives his speech, writing or character
2. Make inferences about other writers or speakers personalities, characters and can therefore analyse their text or speech to discover intended outcomes

Constructing a persona to meet the needs of your rhetoric does not hide you from the readers, on the contrary, it puts you right in front of them and interacts with them purposefully and effectively.[^1]
