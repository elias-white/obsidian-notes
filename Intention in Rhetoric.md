A rhetoriticans intention is what he or she wants to happen as a result of their rhetoric, whether it may be emboldened beliefs in an idea or for the audience to take action in some way. 

This intention is not always immediately known to the rhetorician and can be discovered throughout the exploration of the [[Subject Matter in Rhetoric | subject matter ]] and the [[The Rhetorical Triangle | writing process ]].
