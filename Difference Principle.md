The difference principle is [[John Rawls]]'s first principle in what he describes as [[ Principles of Justice as Fairness ]].

This principle states that all social goods are to be distributed equally, unless an unequal distribution would be to everyone's advantage. To Rawls, a *just* structure arranges social and economic inequalities such that they are to the greatest advantage of the least well off group. 

This basic structure ensures that no social or economic function can take advantage and advance at the cost of another group. 

In support of this principle, Rawls employs the [[Original Position]].

### Inequality 
The only inequalities that are permitted here would be ones that serve to benefit the long-term prospects of the least well off group.

#### Wealth Gap? 
Rawls believes that there is no need to 'mind the gap' when it comes to wealth inequality. Instead, the focus should be on whether the economy is organised in a way that the poor are, over time, becoming better off.

#### How do inequalities advance the positions of the worst off?
- Allowing individuals to earn more income allows them to cover the costs of their education and training, and therefore provide incentive for jobs that are in high-demand
- Without these differences, Rawls states that nobody will be motivated to do one job over another
