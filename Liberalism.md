Liberalism is a [[ Political Philosophy ]]  that asserts [[ Liberty ]], or freedom, as a principle value. Any restrictions on this liberty must be justified.


#### Liberalism on political persons
Liberalism presupposes the individual as a rational, self-interested and self-sufficient being. 

However, Liberal theorists tend to be divided over the nature of [[ Liberty ]] (see: [[ Rousseau on Freedom ]]), the place of property and [[Democracy]] in a [[ Justice | just ]] society, and the comprehensiveness and reach of the liberal ideal (i.e. how should liberal ideals apply, if at all, to those who don't believe in those ideals).

Some competing theories include:
- [[ Radical Democrats ]]
- [[ Communism ]]
- [[ Conservatism ]]
