A post hoc fallacy, or post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, is the idea that because something occurred first, it is the direct cause for something that happened afterwards. 

An example of this might be deciding to drink red bull before winning a soccer game and assuming you won that game because you drank red bull prior. This is a post hoc fallacy.
