In [[Rhetoric]], an Appeal to [[Logos]] occurs when the speaker or writer appeals to the audiences sense of reason, or logic.

Appeals to Logos usually come in the form of data, graphics, quotes, facts. They can also come in the form of contrast, hypothesis or narratives about cause and effect. 

An appeal to logos can either be [[ Situated Appeal | situated]] or [[ Invented Appeal | invented]].
