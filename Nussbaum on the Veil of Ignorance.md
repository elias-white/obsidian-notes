[[ Martha Nussbaum]] has pointed out that under [[ John Rawls ]] conception of society as reciprocity or mutual benefit, agents that are within the [[ original position ]]([[Veil of Ignorance | behind the veil]]) choosing the two principles Rawls calls the [[Principles of Justice as Fairness]], are only doing so due to the presumption of reciprocity. Nussbaum states that persons may not always be able to reciprocate due to disabilities and Rawls replies that these outliers are to be managed through legislation at a later stage as this is a matter of charity, not justice.
