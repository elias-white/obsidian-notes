#### What is the Quadrivium?
- The Quadrivium contains the following four fields of knowledge:
	- Arithmetic (or the theory of number)
	- Music (the application of the theory of number)
	- Geometry (the theory of space)
	- Astronomy (the application of the theory of space)

- Each field above is not a single subject, rather, a group of connected subjects. For example:
	- Arithmetic includes calculus, algebra, theory of equations
	- Music also includes physics, chemistry
	- Geometry includes trigenometry 
	- Astronomy includes engineering, architecture, surveying, geography
