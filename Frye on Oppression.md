[[Marilyn Frye]] prefaces her arguments on oppression with a warning on overusing the term, as she is concerned that it will be 'stretched to meaninglessness'.

To do this, she makes a very clear definition in order to distinguish it from other kinds of harm. [[Marilyn Frye]] states that [[Oppression]] is "an enclosing structure of forces and barriers which tends to the immobilization and reduction of a group or category of people."[^1]

She continues on to state that oppression is [[ Systematic Oppression | systematic ]] and draws analogy with the use of a [[ Frye's Birdcage Analogy| birdcage ]]. Frye argues that "the inhabitent of the 'cage' is not an individual but a group, all those of a certain category".[^2] By this definition, she states that a man can not be oppressed *as* a man, although, he might be oppressed as a member of some other group.

[[Marilyn Frye]] also states that oppressed is *contenxt-sensitive*: if you want to see if a particular harm or enclosing barrier is related to being oppressed, you need to look at the context.

To [[Marilyn Frye]], the mere presence of a barrier does not constitute [[ oppression ]], you have to first ask a few questions:
	-  Who constructs and maintains it?
	-  Whose interests are served by its existence? Who does it benefit?
	-  Is it a part of a wider structure which tends to confine, reduce and immobilize some group? Is the individual a member of the confined group?
