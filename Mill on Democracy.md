[[ John Stuart Mill ]] was a key advocate for [[Representative Democracy]]. 
He believed that [[Direct Democracy]] held a lot of inefficiencies. 

He overall preferred [[Democracy]] over non-democratic states, as he believed by giving all people some elements of political power, it would force decision-makers to take into account the interests, rights and opinions of wider society. 

He stated that [[Democracy]] provides a sense of responsibility, empowerment and autonomy and therefore improves the citizen's moral and intellectual traits and as a consequence, would make for better decisions and better laws.

However, [[John Stuart Mill]] had a few conditions for [[ Democracy ]] to work:
	- Persons must have an education to be eligible for citizenship
	- Power should be dispersed throughout different agencies of the state, to avoid centralisation and corruption
	- Restrictions on spending (election campaigns)
	- Illiterate people should not be allowed to vote
	- Weighted voting -- well educated people are given more than one vote
	- Minorities must have fair representation in government
	
#### Criticisms 
Instead of sacrificing freedom, as can be seen in [[Rousseau on Democracy | Rousseau's democracy]], [[John Stuart Mill]] sacrifices equality.
