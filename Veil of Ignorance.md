The Veil of Ignorance describes the state of individuals undergoing the [[Original Position]] where we are deprived of all knowledge of ourselves -- for example we don't know if we're religious or athiest; intelligent, atheltic, artistic, rich or poor.


#### What do we have behind the veil?
However, behind this veil we still are still able to or have:
- Negotiate our conception of what is good
- All our primary goods (basic rights and liberties,  freedom of choice and movement, and social bases of self-respect (i.e. recognition by social institutions that give individuals a sense of self-worth or confidence))
- Mutual disinterest (not take interest in the individual circumstances of others)
