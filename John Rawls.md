John Rawls is a Political Philosopher who can be described as an [[ Ideal Theory | Ideal Theorist ]]. 

Rawls tasked himself with finding a preferred conception of economic justice, which we could then use to evaluate existing arrangements/institutions. He comes up with the notion of the [[Principles of Justice as Fairness]], which he supports with the use of the [[Original Position]].

#### Criticisms of Rawls conception of justice
- For Rawls, we measure how well or worse off someone is by seeing how many 'primary goods' they have
- Should a lazy person who has very little primary goods be supported? Is it *just* for the hard-working to subsidize the lazy persons?
