### Social Contract Theory (Hobbes, Locke)
-  Parties in the [[State of Nature]] are assumed to be free, equal and independant
-  They seek to satisfy similar interests under conditions of moderate scarcity
-  Parties contract out of the state of nature to secure benefits that aren't available to them in the absence of social cooperation
-  Parties are moved by their own prospective advantage
