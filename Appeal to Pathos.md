In [[Rhetoric]], an Appeal to [[ Pathos ]] occurs when the speaker or writer acknowledges the audience or their own feelings on a topic. It is an appeal to emotion. Aristotle believed appeals to pathos was a direct path to persuasion.

Exaggerated uses of [[ Pathos ]] can be seen in [[ Over-sentimentalisation ]], [[ The scare tactic ]], [[ The false need ]], [[Slippery slope| the slippery slope fallacy ]]. 

An appeal to pathos can either be [[ Situated Appeal | situated]] or [[ Invented Appeal | invented]].
