[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] defines the general will as that which is to be taken as the common good. A key notion of the general will is that it must only produce laws that affect **all citizens**, rather than targeting particular individuals or groups.

It is through popular assemblies that the general will is discovered.

It is often mistaken for [[ Rousseau's Conception of the Will of All | will of all]].
