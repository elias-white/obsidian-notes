Definitions of oppression can vary over the course of history. Early historical periods saw Oppression as being acts of personal violence, enslavement and exercises of tyranny by a ruling group.

By the 19th century, Oppression no longer widely seen as a formal relationship between different people (i.e. tyrants and their subjects). Rather, social structures and norms that promote inequality could also be seen as sources of oppression. 

#### A Philosophical Interpretation of Oppression
While individuals can be oppressed, the ordinary philosophical interpretation is that oppression is a condition or attribute of *groups*. 

#### Oppression as a condition of groups
- For every oppressed group, there is a privelaged group in relation to it 
- Any individual have multiple group identities (gender, race, sexuality, class, physical ability) -- people are not oppressed to the same extent or in the same ways
