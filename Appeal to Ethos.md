In [[Rhetoric]], an Appeal to [[Ethos]] occurs when the writer or speaker uses character, brand or reputation in order to support their argument. 

Some misuses if ethos can be seen in [[ Authority over evidence ]] and [[Ad hominem]].

An appeal to ethos can either be [[ Situated Appeal | situated]] or [[ Invented Appeal | invented]]. 

> "we believe fair-minded people to a greater extent and more quickly \[than we do others], on all subjects in general and completely so in cases where there is not exact knowledge but room for doubt \[...] character is almost, so to speak, the most authoritative form of persuasion" (Aristotle, On Rhetoric)
