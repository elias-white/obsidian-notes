The Five Canons of [[ Rhetoric ]] or Five Stages of Writing Rhetoric is the invention of the roman Philosopher, Cicero. The five canons are:

1. Invention

In the invention stage, the writer discovers what has been said, how it's been said or what might be said in response to a topic.

3. Arrangement

In the the arrangement stage, the writer begins to look at what argument he will make and in what structure he will make it.

5. Elocution (style)

In the elocution stage, the writer will look at how he/she adapts words, topics or sentences to suit the argument he/she is making.

7. Memory

Memory is the process of committing a text to memory. Although this canon is not as applicable to writing as it is to oratory, there are still occasions when writers must memorize their texts in order to make the delivery (the fifth canon) more effective.[^1]

9. Delivery

In the delivery stage, the writer looks at how he will deliver the argument. Using fast or slow speech? Seriously or relaxed? Loudly or quietly? Stand still, or pace back and form? In a poem or an essay?
