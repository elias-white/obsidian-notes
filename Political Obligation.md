Our political obligation refers to our *moral duty* to obey the laws of the state, simply because *it is the law* and not because of some moral justification. 

Our political obligation differs from our[[ Legal Obligation | legal obligations]] and [[Civil Obligation | civil obligations]].

Our moral duty to obey the law is widely to be considered a [[Prima Facie Duty | prima facie duty]], as our political obligations are defeasible. It is also considered to be:
	1. **General**, as in this duty extends to the *entire body of law* in a given jurisdiction
	2. **Universal**, as in the duty to obey is borne to all persons living within that jurisidiction
	
Many Philosophers agree that political obligation holds the normative definition: ***All citizens* have an obligation to obey the laws of their country, as logn as it is reasonably just.** However, [[ Anarchism | Anarchists ]] disagree with this notion. 

#### Can we justify political obligation? 

Contemporary Philosophers usually offer one of the following five justifications in support of Political Obligation: 
1. [[ Argument from Consent | Consent]]
2. Gratitude
3. [[Argument from Fairness | Fairness]]
4. Membership or Association
5. [[ Argument from Natural Duty | Natural Duty]]
