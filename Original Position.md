The Original Position is a thought experiement created by [[John Rawls]] where people select principles of justice without knowing how they were going to be affected by them. This lack of knowing is what Rawls calls the [[Veil of Ignorance]].

Using this [[Veil of Ignorance]], Rawls believes people will select two principles which he names titles [[Principles of Justice as Fairness]]:
1. [[ Principle of Equal Basic Liberties ]]
2. [[ Difference Principle ]]
Rawls also notes that the first principle would take priority over the second.
